Hello friends, welcome to my github pages.

I actually decided to go with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) to write posts, but since it doesn't supports user pages you can find it [here](https://adiell.github.io/fp-blog/).

You can play with a silly app to detect covid-19 in images [here](https://young-castle-22958.herokuapp.com/).
